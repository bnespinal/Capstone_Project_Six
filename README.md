Description/Purpose: For this project, I have gone back and worked on my blogging site. With this project, I have worked on adding 
additional functionality. I have managed to get PHPMailer to work now, unfortunately, though, the authentication is not passing. This issue
is being caused by the email account that is the host account for this mailing system. I am using the account that was used back in CSCI 409
in Spring 2019. The password was changed and I do not know what it is now. I tried creating an email account to act as a host, but I believe it
must be set up a certain way, which I do not know. Additionally, I have removed some links from the navigation bar, adding more functionality
to other pages. I have also been working in meddling with HTML and have changed some of the layout of the website.

Dependencies: This project depends on data tables created in phpmyadmin, and the ccuresearch server which hosts this 
webpage.

Usage: This project can be used to view a blog webpage and use some of its functionalities, which includes registering 
as a user, and writing posts, searching for users and blogs, viewing/updating user information, viewing all blogs at once. 
You can also choose what type of account you wish to open. Also, there is email verification!

Future Work: For future work, I would like to email verification working with a host account appropriately set up. 
Also, I would like to input an a function that allows users to upload photos to their feed, and to their profile and work more with HTML
improving the layout and appearance of the site.

Major and Project Relation: I am an Information Systems major with a minor in Graphic Design. One field that employees
in this field work in is webpage development and functionality.
